# itembancindex
Item Banc creates a base of value using the validators reports of the prices of 14 basic human need items around the world.
We have integrated solana authentication to allow validators (those who enter prices) to be tracked in the database for security
and to be ultimately rewarded with utility tokens.
Our current web2 website is at https://itembancindex.io
When this web3 version is ready it will be accessible through the Item Banc Index site.
